# Visitron Dual Z Stack Python Script

Code Written Originally for Melina Scholtze by Arne, then Oli  

This code when run on VisiView from [Visitron](https://www.visitron.de/), allows for the user to define two different acquisition settings for the same timelapse. 

**Eg.** One Brightfield Stack acquisition of 10 planes and a step of 1um, followed by a 2 channel fluorescent acquisition with 3 planes and a step of 0.24um.

Contains a simple GUI that manages to get and set laser powers and remembers previous settings.
